# ada-2023-project-biasbusters

Everyone has to read [project info page](https://epfl-ada.github.io/teaching/fall2023/cs401/projects/#p2-project-proposal-and-initial-analyses).

[One-slider](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/10QFtgR-_mDdTuwx33ddA89QKRuq1UcDeD--XqxoktSQ/edit#slide=id.g15c22716fae_0_249) (see speaker notes for details).

In P2, **we don't have to do** the project, but **we have to prove** that we can complete the project using code and reasoning. We have to show that:
- we understand the data (format, distributions, correlations, etc)
- we transformed it necessarily (added features, prepared, handled missed values, etc)
- we plan on using necessary methods, and we give mathematical details in the notebook
- we described the timeline and milestones until the finish of P3

So, we need to mitigate any pitfalls and cover any potential problems. Moreover, we need to provide a 1000-word readme describing everything in detail.

## Checklist for P2:
- [x] Choose the project topic
- [ ] Meet and split the work
- [ ] ...
- [ ] Complete notebook
- [ ] Complete 1000-word README, delete unnecessary details (including this checklist)
- [ ] Submit

<Here we should put ~ 1000 words, see links above>
